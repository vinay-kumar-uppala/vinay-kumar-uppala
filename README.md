<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Vinay Kumar Uppala ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer | Space Tech Enthusiast | Deep Learning & Geospatial Developer</h3>

---

I'm a passionate software engineer currently working at **Dhruva Space**, where I contribute to building software systems used in **satellite tracking**, **telemetry**, and **geospatial intelligence**.

Over the past few years, I've worked on several projects involving **satellite imagery**, where I built **automated pipelines** for image processing and **web-based geospatial applications**. Iâ€™ve also integrated **STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog)** workflows to make satellite data easier to discover and access â€” something Iâ€™m genuinely excited about.

Currently, I'm diving deeper into **deep learning**, particularly where it intersects with **remote sensing** and **image analysis**.

**What drives me?**  
Solving real-world problems through clean, scalable software â€” especially in domains like **space tech**, **geospatial applications**, and **machine learning**.  
I also enjoy working across teams and learning from different disciplines. Thereâ€™s always something new to explore.

**Excited to connect and collaborate!**  
Whether you're working on satellite ground stations, data pipelines, mapping tools, or anything ML-related â€” letâ€™s build something together.
